IR Remote controlled Lamp
===============
This project involves using an IR remote to control a lamp in my room.  The lamp is attached to a circuit breaker, controlled by an Arduino Mega.  The IR key-presses will be mapped to lamp controlling commands, such as "turn light off" or "increase light intensity", and will be processed instaneously by a forever for loop running on the Arduino.
